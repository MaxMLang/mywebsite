      <description>Introduction I recently had some free time, so I analized the latest TidyTuesday Dataset in R.

If your Economics Knowledge is a little rusty like mine, you should read the Wikipedia links before looking at the Graphs. The Article on The Economistâ€™s Website can be found here.</description>
