      <description>After an interesting presentation by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Agnes Jocher of the TU Munich about the Hyperloop this interesting question just came to my mind: “Will more transportation mehtods actually lead to a decrease in CO2 emissions?”
The population of earth is still increasing exponentially, more and more people will have access to (public) transportation and third world countries keep developing (That is great of course!), which will lead to an increase in global energy usage.</description>

      <description>Who is George and how did I get in touch with him? George, Co-Founder of the “Right to Movement Initiative”, and I connected over a Konrad-Adenauer-Foundation event a week ago, where he presented the “Right to Movement Initiative” and answered questions about Palestine overall. George Zeidan is 30 years old, a Fulbright awardee with a master’s degree from the Price School of Public Policy, University of Southern California and program manager for an international humanitarian organization.</description>

      <description>How Covid generated an (almost) complete digital World. During the Covid-19 pandemic everybody was and still is forced to stay home. Countries have enacted harsh lockdown laws and everybody was feeling the power of the state again after a really long time. Some more, some less. It is interesting however, how this “new” life is bringing up new problems. “Should I meet my friends or is it too dangerous, because of the current situation?</description>
