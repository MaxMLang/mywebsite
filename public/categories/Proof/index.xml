      <description>We are living in crazy times. Everything that was normal before has changed during the Covid-19 pandemic. That might make you wonder: “What did not change?”, “Are qudratic polynoms still continous?”. Ok, nobody did/would ever say this (LOL), but I really did not know how to introduce this topic.
In my Calculus class we introduced the Definition of conituity a couple of weeks ago which is the following
Let \(M \subseteq \mathbb{C}, \zeta \in M .</description>

      <description>Proof Wilson’s theorem states:
Let p be a prime. Then
$ (p - 1)! \equiv -1 \quad mod \;p $
$ \text{Each a} \{1 , 2, ..., p - 1 \} \text{has a inverse } a^{-1} \in \{ 1 , 2, ..., p - 1 \} \; mod \;p \text{ with } a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 \text{.} $
$ \text{This inverse } a^{-1} \text{ is unique and via the power laws follows that } {a^{-1}}^{-1} = a \; (mod\;p)\text{.</description>
