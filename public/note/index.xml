      <description>Happy New Year I wish everyone a happy new year and all the best for 2021.
2020 defintely was different. Covid 19, everybody staying at home, even on New Years Eve it was mostly silent. It seems strange, but to be completly honest I enjoyed it. The only question I ask myself is: What will be normal after the pandemic?
Everybody keeps saying: &amp;ldquo;I wish everything would just be normal again.</description>

Enjoy!
