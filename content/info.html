<h4>Why Statistics? Asia was the reason.</h4>
<p>Since 2020 I have been following my passion for using data for real world impact by studying statistics at LMU Munich and the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>I caught interest in studying statistics and the related tasks during my stay in China. After graduating from high school in 2019, I spent almost 4 months in Shanghai and 5 months in Singapore to learn Chinese (Mandarin). Due to the corona pandemic, I had to leave China in advance at the end of January 2020. Hence, I flew to Singapore to continue my course.
At the end of my course in Singapore I reached the HSK 5 language level, which is equivalent to a C1 of the CEFN.</p>
<p>In both ultra-modern Asian countries I became aware that statistics will have a huge impact on our everyday lives in the future.
I also want to contribute and be a part of this chance to change the world. That’s why I study statistics.</p>

<h2>The rest of my Story</h2>
<p>My time before China is quickly told: Together with my friends, I played tenorhorn in the <em>Knabenkapelle Nördlingen</em> and traveled to several cities to give concerts. Music connects people, enriches society and gave me great pleasure. That’s why I learned another instrument during my time in China. Dizi (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0otKgaQ7gNs">笛子</a>） - a Chinese flute.
From 5th grade starting I began to pursue my passion for basketball as a player and referee, later as a scout and referee at TSV Nördlingen. To achieve a goal together through hustle and hard work was a real enrichment for me.
The award of the <em>Sportehrennadel der Stadt Nördlingen</em> in 2017 was the result of years of training and a great team experience. Through music and sport I made friends all over the globe. Books and magazines filled the rest of my free time.</p>
<p>That is it.</p>
