# Welcome
This website is a documentation of my statistics studies at LMU Munich. I would like to share interesting assignments, programs, mathematical proofs such as calculations here on this website.

Furthermore I would like to improve my R Blogdown Skills by keeping this website up to date.

In addition to the technical [posts](/posts/), will I share some interesting thoughts on interesting current events under [notes](/note/).

I look forward to receiving feedback via Disqus or Github.
