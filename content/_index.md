# Welcome
This website is a documentation of my statistics studies at LMU Munich. I would like to share interesting assignments, programs, mathematical proofs such as calculations here on this website.

In addition to the technical [posts](/post/), I want to share my opinon on interesting current events or (in my opinion) interesting topics under [notes](/note/). That will include topics like politics, lifestyle, literature and so on.

I look forward to receive feedback via Disqus or Github.

The website is built with a simple Hugo Theme. The reason is, that I would like to improve my R Blogdown Skills by keeping this website up to date.
