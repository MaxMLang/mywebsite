# Welcome 

My name is Max Lang, and I am a student in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford. I'm from Germany and currently live in Oxford.

This website contains some information about myself as well as a few blog pieces I've written. The majority of them are on issues that I found intriguing throughout my studies, such as data analysis in R, minor programming projects, or mathematical proofs. 
I like reading a lot of books and studying Chinese/Mandarin on a regular basis, thus you could find some reviews or information on Chinese culture here.

The nerdy/technical pieces are posted under [posts](/post/), while my thoughts on current events, book reviews, and Chinese cultural information are listed under [notes](/note/).

I eagerly await comments through Disqus or Github.

The website is built with a simple Hugo Theme, because I would like to improve my R Blogdown Skills by keeping this website up to date.
