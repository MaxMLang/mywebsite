# Happy New Year
I wish everyone a happy new year and all the best for 2021.

2020 defintely was different. Covid 19, everybody staying at home, even on New Years Eve it was mostly silent. It seems strange, but to be completly honest I enjoyed it. The only question I ask myself is: What will be normal after the pandemic? 

Everybody keeps saying: "I wish everything would just be normal again.", "I want it to be normal again." and so on and so on. But in retrospect our life before Covid-19 was not normal at all. It was sometimes crazy - in a good and bad way. 

So after all the world went through in 2020 will our life actually be normal in 2021?
